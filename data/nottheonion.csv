Moving Forward,"This subreddit has long taken a stance against unreliable sources of news. We remove blogs, opinion pieces, and satire. [We are notoriously strict about this policy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval) 

So while we have already been removing unreliable sources of news under Rule 4, starting immediately we will be banning all sources of fake news. We believe that President Trump is correct in his assessment of the lying fake news outlets, the Mainstream Media (AKA the lamestream media), and we are following in the footsteps of our Commander in Chief.

In this age of ever increasing fake news, we believe it is important to have access to reliable, unbiased reporting. We have a duty to our readers here at /r/NotTheOnion to provide the most accurate, up to date news that we can, and we are striving hard to do so. We want to be on the right side of history, and we believe that this is the correct choice.

As such, the only news outlets that will be allowed to be posted here from now on will be from the following:

*    www.breitbart.com

*    www.drudgereport.com

*    www.foxnews.com

*    www.infowars.com

*    www.rt.com

We respectfully request that no source of fake news are posted to this subreddit.

"[META] With our recent explosive growth, I've decided to re-think and re-phrase the sidebar. Your feedback is welcome.","So I'm posting because of a couple of reasons:

1. The vast majority of you have subscribed since 9 March. BTW, if anyone knows what the hell happened, I'd love to know. :) Here's a graph of the traffic stats: http://i.imgur.com/r798v.jpg

2. Seems like political submissions have been on a drastic rise, which I think is generally okay, but.. well... check out the sidebar. I want us to be fair, and it's difficult for me because as a liberal, I tend to laugh at the absurdity of conservatives; but at the same time, I want to be fair to them and not run them off from this subreddit.

3. So there's a culture, but most of you are new to it. I think the past few days have gone well, but I want to try and make sure we keep things polite and funny. I think this is turning into a fantastic community, and I want to keep it that way. :)

4. I have a proposed guideline to add: Trolls will not be tolerated. I don't wish to define what a troll is in concrete terms so they can't argue, but any account with decent negative karma who has a button-pushing name and who makes button-pushing posts... I think we all generally recognize trolls... I am generally going to remove their posts and/or ban them from this subreddit. They cause havoc and tear communities apart. We want laughs here, not lulz. And yet, I still think I can claim to take a gentle hand with moderation. I will not silence anyone who I believe is making an honest post (please don't push the limit on this, mind, but in general -- I haven't removed a single comment so far in this subreddit, and only IIRC one or two submissions)

I welcome your feedback. :)",nottheonion,1332239646,[deleted],4,11,2012-03-20
